        The Pick Contacts Intent defines a Web Intent [[!WEBINTENTS]] that enables access to a user's
        address book service from inside a Web application. It defines both an Intent action/type
        pair that selects this operation, and the format of the contacts data that is returned
        by services implementing this specification
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        This document builds atop previous versions that were pure JavaScript APIs and turns them
        into an API built using Web Intents, while maintaining the data format which the JavaScript
        APIs had defined.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Every operating system and a large number of Web-based service providers have different ways of
        representing address book information. Most users are required to maintain a plurality of contact lists
        which leads to multiple copies of address book data. This in turn often leads to disjoint and inconsistent
        information being stored across a user's address book providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        When sharing contact data with third parties users are, more often than not, required to hand over access to
        their whole address book. Users are implicitly required to trust third parties with all of their data
        when, in reality, the user may only wish, or need, to share a subset of their address book information so
        that an application can fulfil its purpose. When sharing of only a subset of a user's address book is
        possible, it often requires the user to type the information into a form herself rather than having it
        extracted from one of her address book services.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification enables a Web application to have access to a selected subset of a user's address book,
        obtained from arbitrary services not known to the Web application. The interactions, brokered using
        Web Intents [[!WEBINTENTS]] are designed in order to maximise the user's security and privacy.
        Address book data may be sourced from a plurality of sources — both online and local to the user's device
        — so long as those sources are registered as Intent services with the user agent. It defines a common
        format which services use to provide data to Web applications in a consistent and interoperable manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expectation is that data sharing happens with explicit user permission and filtering. The focus of 
        this data sharing is on making the user aware of the data that they will share and putting them at the 
        centre of the data sharing process; free to select both the extent to which they share their address 
        book information and the ability to restrict which pieces of information related to which contact gets shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        A set of <a href="#security-and-privacy-considerations">Security and Privacy Considerations</a> are
        presented for the discretion of both implementers of Pick Contacts Intent services and recipients of contact
        information (i.e. Web applications).
      </p>
      <p>
        The following code illustrates how to obtain contact information from a user's address book:
      </p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
        var intent = new Intent({ action:   "http://webintents.org/pick",
                                  type:     "http://w3.org/type/contact",
                                  extras:   { fields: ["displayName", "emails"] }});
        navigator.startActivity(intent, contactsOK, contactsFail);

        function contactsOK (contacts) {
            // iterate over the array of contacts to do something useful with them
        }
        function contactsFail (err) {
            // display an error to the user
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        When the above code is run, the user would typically be prompted by her user agent to select
        a service able to pick a contact (there may be several such services, if she has multiple address
        book sources). Upon selecting a service, she will be presented with an interface enabling her
        to choose what contact information is returned to the Web application. Upon completing her
        choice, the contacts data would be returned to the Web application in the <code>contactsOK</code>
        callback.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        There is only one single conformance requirement placed upon the <dfn>user agent</dfn>
        product: a <a>user agent</a> MUST support Web Intents [[!WEBINTENTS]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The conformance criteria in this specification apply to a single product: the
        <dfn>contact service</dfn> which exposes a Web Intent service that
        handles Pick Contact Intents as defined in this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data returned by the <a>contact service</a> is described in this specification using [[!WEBIDL]].
        When this data is provided using JavaScript, then the <a>contact service</a> MUST do so in a manner
        consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        The Intent defined in this specification can be used to find contact information from a user's address
        books. This discloses information related to a user's contacts such as their phone numbers, email
        addresses and other personally identifying information. The distribution of this information could
        potentially compromise the user's privacy, or the user's contacts' privacy. A conforming implementation
        of this specification should provide a mechanism that protects the user's privacy and this mechanism should
        ensure that no contact information is retrievable without the user's express permission.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Privacy considerations for implementers of the Pick Contacts Intent</h2>
        <p>
          A <a>contact service</a> should not provide contact information to Web sites without the express
          permission of the user. Obtaining the user's express permission to access a set of contacts does 
          not imply that the user has granted permission for the same Web site to access more contact information.
          A <a>contact service</a> should take great care to ensure that the user can clearly see which information
          is about to be shared, and must not share more information than has been requested by the Web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>user agent</a> may have prearranged trust relationships with a specific <a>contact service</a> 
          that do not require such user interaction.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Privacy considerations for recipients of contact information</h2>
        <p>
          Web sites operators that retrieve contacts information using this Intent are denoted as recipients
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients should only request contact information when necessary, and only use the contact
          information for the task for which it was provided to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients should dispose of contact information once that task is completed, unless expressly
          permitted to retain it by the user. Recipients should also take measures to protect this information
          against unauthorised access. If contact information is stored, users should be allowed to update and
          delete this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipient of contact information should not retransmit the contact information without the
          user's express permission. Care should be taken when retransmitting and use of encryption is
          encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients should clearly and conspicuously disclose the fact that they are collecting contact data,
          the purpose of the collection, how long the data is retained, how the data is secured, how the data is
          shared if it is shared, how users can access, update and delete the data, and any other choices that
          users have with respect to the data. This disclosure should include an explanation of any exceptions to
          the guidelines listed above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that even if a user gives permission to share their contact information this can have serious
          privacy implications for those parties whose contacts are shared, as they may not wish such sharing to
          occur. This should be considered by Web applications when requesting and using such information.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Additional implementation considerations</h2>
        <p>
          Further to the requirements listed in the previous section, implementers of a <a>user agents</a> are
          also advised to consider the following aspects that can negatively affect the privacy of their users:
          in certain cases, users can inadvertently grant permission to disclose their contacts
          to Web sites. In other cases, the content hosted at a certain URL changes in such a way that the
          previously granted contact permissions no longer apply as far as the user is concerned. Or the users
          might simply change their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Predicting or preventing these situations is inherently difficult. Mitigation and in-depth defensive
          measures are a <a>user agent</a>'s responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However, in
          designing these measures, implementers are advised to enable user awareness of information sharing, and to
          provide easy access to user interfaces that enable revocation of permissions that Web applications have to
          access this Intent.

      <h2>Intent Description</h2>
      <p>
        The action for this Intent is <code>http://webintents.org/pick</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type for this Intent is <code>http://w3.org/type/contact</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a <a>contact service</a> is matched for delivery using these action and type, it
        MUST respond in one of two ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If contacts have been successfully selected for delivery, then a successful payload is returned
          to the client (using <code>postResult()</code>) matching the data format defined below.
        </li>
        <li>
          If an error of any kind takes place in the service, then an error payload is returned (using
          <code>postFailure()</code>) matching the error data format defined below. The <a>contact service</a>
          MUST NOT treat the user selecting zero contacts or cancelling the service as error conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <section>
        <h2>Intent Extras</h2>
        <p>
          The Pick Contact Intent can be instantiated with an <code>extras</code> field that adheres to the 
          following dictionary.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>The <a>ContactIntentExtras</a> dictionary</h2>
          <p>
            The <a>ContactIntentExtras</a> dictionary describes the options that can be applied to contact searching.

          <dl title='dictionary ContactIntentExtras' class='idl'>
            <dt>DOMString? search</dt>
            <dd>
              A string which provides a hint to the <a>contact service</a> to facilitate contacts selection by the user.
              The exact manner in which this hint is exploited is entirely up to the <a>contact service</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>unsigned long? limit</dt>
            <dd>
              By default a <a>contact service</a> MAY return as many contacts as the user selects. If <code>limit</code>
              is specified, the <a>contact service</a> MUST NOT return more than <code>limit</code> contacts. The
              <a>contact service</a> SHOULD enforce this limitation in the user interface that it exposes.
            </dd>
            <dt>DOMString[] fields</dt>
            <dd>
              An array of field names corresponding to the name of the fields in the <a>Contact</a> dictionary that
              the Web application is requesting from the <a>contact service</a>. The <a>contact service</a> MUST
              NOT return defined fields on the contact objects that it provides other than those present in this
              list. If a field name is provided that the <a>contact service</a> does not recognise as a field
              of the <a>Contact</a> dictionary, then it MUST ignore it.

      <section>
        <h2>The <a>Contact</a> dictionary</h2>
        <p>
